The `reorderQueue` function aims to reorder a queue of integers using a stack and a queue. Here's an algorithmic explanation:

### Algorithm for Reordering a Queue

1. **Print Initial Queue**: Output the initial sequence of the queue.

2. **Load Queue**: Load the elements from the vector `v` into the queue `q`.

3. **Transfer Half to Stack**: Move the first half of the queue `q` into the stack `st`.

4. **Return Stack to Queue**: Push back all elements from the stack `st` into the queue `q`.

5. **Transfer Half to Stack Again**: Move the first half of the queue `q` (which consists of the elements originally from the stack `st`) back into the stack `st`.

6. **Interleave Stack and Queue**: Alternately push elements from the top of the stack `st` and the front of the queue `q` back into the queue `q`.

7. **Empty Queue to Stack**: Transfer all elements from the queue `q` to the stack `st`.

8. **Transfer Back to Queue**: Move all elements from the stack `st` back into the queue `q`.

9. **Output New Order**: Print the reordered queue by dequeuing from the front and enqueueing at the back.

The purpose of this reordering is not directly apparent from the code, but the operations perform a series of reversals and interleavings that change the order of the elements in the queue. The exact nature of the reorder will depend on the number of elements and their initial order. The final print out gives the new order of the queue after these operations.
