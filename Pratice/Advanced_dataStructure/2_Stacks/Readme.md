# STACKS

## intro

    - 1 ) The best example of stack is CD rack. 
    - 2 ) If you want to acess the CD located at the base,
        Remove all CD one by one, 
        Get What you want and then put everything back 
    - 3 ) While acessing any middle element in Stack, 
            Remove all the top elements, STORE then in a temp Data Sctructure
            and put them back when your work is done

    - 4) 
        a)ST.push()
        b)ST.pop() // Removes topmost element 
        c)ST.top() // Returns topmost element
        d)ST.size()
        e)ST.empty() // Boolean Empty or not

        At a given index, 
            T.C = O (N)
            S.C = O (N)

    -5) Recursion, (WORKD on STACK)
    -6) Last IN First Out


    Time Complexity 
    || Opperations ||    Arrays ||   Stacks ||  Linked List ||
    get             |    O(1)    |    O(N) | O (N)
    insert          |    O(N)    |  O(N)    | O(N)
    delete          |    O(N)    | O (1)    | O (N)

Space Complexity 
    || Opperations ||    Arrays ||   Stacks ||  Linked List ||
    get             |    O(1)    |    O(N) | O (1)
    insert          |    O(N)    |  O(N)    | O(1)
    delete          |    O(N)    | O (N)    | O (1)


## Stack overflow
    -1) When you try to push an element, when the stack is full, STACK overflow

## Stack Underflow
        -1) When you try to pop, top an empty stack


# POP
# ANSWER
# PUSH
