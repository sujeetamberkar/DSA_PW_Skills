# Can See Persons Count Calculation

## Objective
For each person in a line, calculate how many people they can see in front of them. A person can see the people shorter than them until they encounter a person taller than them.

## Code Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - A vector `answer` is initialized to store the count of people that each person can see.
   - A stack `st` is used to keep track of the heights of the people that have been processed.

2. **Iterate Backwards**:
   - The loop starts from the second last person and moves backwards.
   - For each person, count how many people they can see until a taller person is encountered.

3. **Pop Stack Elements**:
   - If the current person is taller than the person at the top of the stack, pop the stack.
   - Increment the count for each person popped.

4. **Update Answer**:
   - After popping from the stack, update `answer[i]` with the count.
   - If the stack is not empty after popping, it means the current person can see one more person (the next taller person), so increment `answer[i]` by one.

5. **Push Current Person onto Stack**:
   - Push the current person's height onto the stack for the next iteration.

6. **Return Answer**:
   - The `answer` vector contains the count of people each person can see in front of them.

## Dry Run
Given the array: `[10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9]`

### Iteration and Stack Dynamics
- Start with `answer` initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Stack initially contains the height of the last person: `st = [9]`.

- For index 4 (`11`): Clears the stack, count is `1` (for `9`). `answer[4]` is `1`.
- For index 3 (`5`): `11` is taller, so `answer[3]` is `1`.
- For index 2 (`8`): Pops `5`, sees `11`, so count is `1` and `answer[2]` is `2`.
- For index 1 (`6`): Pops `8`, `5`, sees `11`, so count is `2` and `answer[1]` is `3`.
- For index 0 (`10`): Pops `6`, `8`, `5`, sees `11`, so count is `3` and `answer[0]` is `4`.

### Corrections
- After reviewing the stack dynamics, we realize that `answer[0]` should be `3` because `10` sees `6`, `8`, and `5` gets blocked by `11`.
- Similarly, `answer[1]` should be `1`, as `6` only sees `8` before getting blocked by `11`.
- The rest of the `answer` values are correct as given in the previous documentation.

### Final Answer
- `answer = [3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`
