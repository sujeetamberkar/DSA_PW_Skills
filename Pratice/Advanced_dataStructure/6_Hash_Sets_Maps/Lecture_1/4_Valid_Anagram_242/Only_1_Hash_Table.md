1. **Function Purpose**: Determine if two strings, `s` and `t`, are anagrams of each other.

2. **Length Check**: 
   - Return `false` if the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal.

3. **Create and Populate Frequency Map for `s`**:
   - Initialize an `unordered_map` named `freq`.
   - Iterate over each character in string `s`.
   - Increment the count for each character in `freq`.

4. **Process String `t` and Update Map**:
   - Iterate over each character in string `t`.
   - Decrement the frequency of each character in `freq`.
   - If the frequency of a character reaches zero, remove that character from `freq`.

5. **Check for Empty Map**:
   - After iterating through `t`, check if `freq` is empty.
   - If `freq` is empty, it means all characters from `s` were matched and used up by characters in `t`, indicating that `s` and `t` are anagrams. Return `true`.
   - If `freq` is not empty, it means there are unmatched characters. Return `false`.
