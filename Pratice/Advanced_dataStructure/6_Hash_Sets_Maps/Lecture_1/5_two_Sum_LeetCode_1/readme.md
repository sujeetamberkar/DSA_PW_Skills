    - 1) If we needed the integers and not the index of int we could have used sets
    
    Steps 
        a) Put all values in a set

        2,5,11,4   Target = 9

        b) Now iterate through array 

        9 - 2 = 7
        7 is not present in the set go ahead

        9 - 5 = 4
        4 is  present in the set
        (thus 4 and 5 are the pair)
