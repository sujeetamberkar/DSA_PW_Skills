1. **Function Purpose**: Find two indices in a vector `nums` such that the numbers at these indices add up to a given `target`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create an empty vector `answer` to store the result (indices of the two numbers).
   - Create an `unordered_map` named `m` to store the numbers and their indices from `nums`.

3. **Iterate Over `nums`**:
   - Loop through each element in the vector `nums`.
   - For each element at index `i`, calculate `complement = target - nums[i]`.

4. **Check for Complement in Map**:
   - Use `m.find(complement)` to search for the `complement` in the map.
   - If found, it means a pair (current number and its complement) adds up to the target.
      - Push the index of the complement (found in the map) to `answer`.
      - Push the current index `i` to `answer`.
      - Break the loop or return `answer` as you've found the pair.

5. **Store Current Number and Index in Map**:
   - If the complement is not found in the map, add the current number and its index to the map for future reference. Use `m[nums[i]] = i`.

6. **Return Result**:
   - Return the vector `answer` which contains the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.

This approach uses a hash table to store elements of `nums` along with their indices. For each element, it checks if the map already contains the complement that adds up to the target. If it does, the indices of these two elements are the required answer.

## dry run 
Let's perform a dry run of the `twoSum` function with the input `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`.

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `answer` is an empty vector.
   - `m` is an empty `unordered_map`.

2. **Iterate Over `nums`**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `nums`.

3. **First Iteration (i = 0, nums[i] = 2)**:
   - Calculate complement: `target - nums[i] = 9 - 2 = 7`.
   - Check if `7` is in map `m`. It's not, since `m` is empty.
   - Add `nums[0] = 2` and its index `0` to map `m`. Now, `m = {2 -> 0}`.

4. **Second Iteration (i = 1, nums[i] = 7)**:
   - Calculate complement: `target - nums[i] = 9 - 7 = 2`.
   - Check if `2` is in map `m`. It is, and `m[2] = 0`.
   - Since we found the complement, add `m[2]` (which is `0`) to `answer`.
   - Add the current index `i` (which is `1`) to `answer`.
   - `answer` now contains `[0, 1]`.

5. **Result**:
   - We've found the two indices where `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`, which is equal to the `target`.
   - The function would return `[0, 1]`.

Therefore, the `twoSum` function correctly identifies indices `0` and `1` in the array `[2, 7, 11, 15]` as the two numbers that add up to the target value `9`.
