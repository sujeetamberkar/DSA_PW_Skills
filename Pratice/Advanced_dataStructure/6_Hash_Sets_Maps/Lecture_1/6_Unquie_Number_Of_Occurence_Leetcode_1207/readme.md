1. **Function Purpose**: Determine if all elements in the vector `arr` have unique occurrence frequencies.

2. **Initialize Hash Map `m`**:
   - Create an `unordered_map` named `m` to store elements from `arr` and their frequencies.

3. **Count Frequencies of Elements in `arr`**:
   - Loop through each element in `arr`.
   - If the element is already in `m`, increment its count.
   - If the element is not in `m`, add it with a count of 1.

4. **Initialize Set `s`**:
   - Create an `unordered_set` named `s` to store unique frequencies.

5. **Store Unique Frequencies in `s`**:
   - Loop through each entry in `m`.
   - Insert the frequency (`.second` of the pair) of each element into `s`.

6. **Compare Sizes of `m` and `s`**:
   - If the sizes of `m` and `s` are equal, it means all frequencies are unique (since sets don't allow duplicates). Return `true`.
   - If the sizes differ, there are duplicate frequencies. Return `false`.

This function first counts the frequencies of each element in the given vector. It then checks if these frequencies are unique by inserting them into a set and comparing the size of the set with the size of the map. If they match, all frequencies are unique.

Let's perform a dry run of the `uniqueOccurrences` function with two different inputs. First, we'll use the input `arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]`, and then we'll use `arr = [1,2]`.

# Dry Run  `arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]`

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - `m[-3]` becomes 3 (since -3 appears 3 times).
   - `m[0]` becomes 2.
   - `m[1]` becomes 4.
   - `m[10]` becomes 1.

2. **Store Unique Frequencies**:
   - Insert into set `s`: frequencies 3, 2, 4, 1.

3. **Compare Sizes of `m` and `s`**:
   - Size of `m` is 4 (elements are -3, 0, 1, 10).
   - Size of `s` is 4 (frequencies are 3, 2, 4, 1).
   - Sizes match, return `true`.

### Dry Run for `arr = [1,2]`

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - `m[1]` becomes 1.
   - `m[2]` becomes 1.

2. **Store Unique Frequencies**:
   - Insert into set `s`: frequencies 1, 1.

3. **Compare Sizes of `m` and `s`**:
   - Size of `m` is 2 (elements are 1, 2).
   - Size of `s` is 1 (frequency 1 appears twice).
   - Sizes do not match, return `false`.

In summary, for the first input `[-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]`, the function returns `true` indicating all elements have unique occurrence frequencies. For the second input `[1,2]`, the function returns `false` as the occurrence frequencies of the elements are not unique.
