# Algorithm
1. **Create a Set**: Store each word from the input vector in a hash set for efficient lookups.

2. **Initialize Count**: Set `count` to zero. This will hold the number of valid string pairs.

3. **Loop Through Words**: Iterate through each word in the input vector.
   
4. **Create Reversed String**:
   - For each word, create a reversed copy named `temp`.

5. **Check and Skip Palindromes**:
   - If a word is a palindrome (i.e., `temp` is equal to the original word), skip further checks for this word.

6. **Find Reversed Pair in Set**:
   - Check if the reversed word (`temp`) exists in the set.
   - If yes, it forms a valid pair with the original word.

7. **Increment Count and Remove from Set**:
   - Increment `count` for each valid pair found.
   - Remove the original word from the set to prevent recounting this pair.

8. **Return Total Count**: The final `count` value is the total number of valid reversible string pairs.

# Dry Run
Let's perform a dry run of the given code with the input `["cd", "ac", "dc", "ca", "zz"]`:

1. **Create a Set with All Words**:
   - Set `s` = {"cd", "ac", "dc", "ca", "zz"}

2. **Initialize Count**:
   - `count = 0`

3. **Iterate Through Each Word**:

   - For "cd":
     - Reversed "cd" = "dc"
     - "dc" is in the set.
     - Increment `count` to 1.
     - Remove "cd" from set. Set `s` = {"ac", "dc", "ca", "zz"}

   - For "ac":
     - Reversed "ac" = "ca"
     - "ca" is in the set.
     - Increment `count` to 2.
     - Remove "ac" from set. Set `s` = {"dc", "ca", "zz"}

   - For "dc":
     - This was paired with "cd" earlier, but "cd" is already removed from the set, so no action here.

   - For "ca":
     - This was paired with "ac" earlier, but "ac" is already removed from the set, so no action here.

   - For "zz":
     - Reversed "zz" = "zz" (a palindrome)
     - Skip this as per the code logic.

4. **Final Count**:
   - `count = 2`

So, the function `maximumNumberOfStringPairs` will return `2` for the input `["cd", "ac", "dc", "ca", "zz"]`. There are two valid reversible string pairs: ("cd", "dc") and ("ac", "ca").
