# Hash Sets 
    - 1) Time Complexity, of Insertion O(1)
    - 2) Time Complexity, of deletion O(1)
    - 3) Time Complexity, of search O(1)

STL functions 
    -> insert()
    -> size()
    -> find()
    -> errase
    -> begin()
    -> end()

## SET only stores unique elements 

# Insertion 
    - 1) The elements are inserted in random order,
    

# Display
    - 1) No head, no top, no tail, no index
    - 2) We use For Each loop
