1. **Remainder Frequency Map (`m`)**:
   - Create frequency map for remainders.

2. **Normalize Negative Remainders**:
   - For each `element` in `arr`:
     - If `element % k` is negative, normalize: `element = (((element % k) + k) % k)`.
     - Increment `m[element]`.

3. **Zero Remainder Special Case**:
   - If `0` in `m`:
     - Check if `m[0]` is odd, if yes return false.
     - Erase `0` from `m`.

4. **Pairing Remainders**:
   - For each `ele` in `m`:
     - Calculate complement: `rem = k - ele`.
     - If `rem` not in `m`, return false.
     - If `m[rem] != m[ele]`, return false.

5. **Return True**:
   - All checks passed, return true.

These points concisely outline the logic of your function to determine if an array can be rearranged so that every pair's sum is divisible by `k`.


Let's perform a dry run of the `canArrange` function with the array `[1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9]` and `k = 5`:

1. **Initialize Remainder Frequency Map (`m`)**:
   - `m` is empty initially.

2. **Process Each Element in the Array**:
   - For each `element`, calculate and normalize the remainder:
     - `1 % 5 = 1` → `m[1] = 1`
     - `2 % 5 = 2` → `m[2] = 1`
     - `3 % 5 = 3` → `m[3] = 1`
     - `4 % 5 = 4` → `m[4] = 1`
     - `5 % 5 = 0` → `m[0] = 1`
     - `10 % 5 = 0` → `m[0] = 2`
     - `6 % 5 = 1` → `m[1] = 2`
     - `7 % 5 = 2` → `m[2] = 2`
     - `8 % 5 = 3` → `m[3] = 2`
     - `9 % 5 = 4` → `m[4] = 2`

   After processing all elements, `m` looks like this:
   - `m = {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2}`

3. **Zero Remainder Special Case**:
   - `m[0]` exists and its frequency is 2, which is even. So, it passes the check.

4. **Pairing Remainders**:
   - For each `ele` in `m`:
     - `ele = 1`: complement `rem = 5 - 1 = 4`. `m[4]` exists and `m[4] = m[1]`.
     - `ele = 2`: complement `rem = 5 - 2 = 3`. `m[3]` exists and `m[3] = m[2]`.
     - `ele = 3`: already checked as a complement of 2.
     - `ele = 4`: already checked as a complement of 1.
     - No need to check `ele = 0` as it was already handled.

5. **Return True**:
   - All checks are passed. The function returns true.

The dry run shows that the array `[1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9]` can be rearranged so that the sum of every pair is divisible by `k = 5`.
