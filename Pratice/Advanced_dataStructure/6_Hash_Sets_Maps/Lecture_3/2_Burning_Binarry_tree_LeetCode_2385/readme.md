### Algorithm: Calculate Time to Infect All Nodes in a Binary Tree

1. **Find Infected Node**:
   - Traverse the tree to locate the node with value equal to `start`.
   - Store the reference to this node.

2. **Map Parent Nodes**:
   - Create a map to associate each node with its parent.
   - Recursively traverse the tree, updating the map with parent-child relationships.

3. **Initialize BFS**:
   - Use a queue for BFS, initially containing the infected node and its level (0).
   - Keep a set to track visited (infected) nodes, starting with the infected node.

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a node and its level.
     - Update the maximum level (`max_Level`).
     - For each neighboring node (left, right, parent):
       - Check if the neighbor is already in the set (infected).
       - If not, enqueue the neighbor with level incremented by 1 and add it to the set.

5. **Result - Maximum Infection Level**:
   - The maximum level in the BFS represents the time to infect all nodes.

### Key Logic Points:

- **Tree Traversal for Initialization**: Finding the starting infected node and mapping parents.
- **BFS for Infection Spread**: Traverses the tree level by level, marking nodes as infected.
- **Neighbor Infection Check**: Ensures each node is visited once, preventing infinite loops.
- **Maintaining Infection Level**: Tracks the depth of BFS, indicating the infection spread time.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm is efficient, avoiding unnecessary repeated processing.

### Outcome:


To perform a dry run of the algorithm with the given binary tree and start value, we'll represent the tree and step through the process:

### Binary Tree Representation:
- The tree: `[1, 5, 3, null, 4, 10, 6, 9, 2]`
- Tree structure:
  ```
      1
     / \
    5   3
     \ / \
     4 10 6
      / \
     9   2
  ```

- Start Node: `3`

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Find Infected Node (`start = 3`)**:
   - The infected node is the node with value `3`.

2. **Map Parent Nodes**:
   - Map each node to its parent:
     - Parent of `5` is `1`.
     - Parent of `3` is `1`.
     - Parent of `4` is `5`.
     - Parent of `10` is `3`.
     - Parent of `6` is `3`.
     - Parent of `9` is `10`.
     - Parent of `2` is `10`.

3. **Initialize BFS**:
   - Start with queue: `[{node: 3, level: 0}]`.
   - Visited set: `{3}`.

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Dequeue `3` (level `0`):
     - Neighbors: `10`, `6`, and parent `1`.
     - Queue now: `[{10, 1}, {6, 1}, {1, 1}]`.
     - Visited set: `{3, 10, 6, 1}`.
   - Dequeue `10` (level `1`):
     - Neighbors: `9`, `2`, and parent `3` (already visited).
     - Queue now: `[{6, 1}, {1, 1}, {9, 2}, {2, 2}]`.
     - Visited set: `{3, 10, 6, 1, 9, 2}`.
   - Dequeue `6` (level `1`):
     - No unvisited neighbors.
   - Dequeue `1` (level `1`):
     - Neighbors: `5` (and `3` already visited).
     - Queue now: `[{9, 2}, {2, 2}, {5, 2}]`.
     - Visited set: `{3, 10, 6, 1, 9, 2, 5}`.
   - Dequeue `9` (level `2`):
     - No unvisited neighbors.
   - Dequeue `2` (level `2`):
     - No unvisited neighbors.
   - Dequeue `5` (level `2`):
     - Neighbor: `4`.
     - Queue now: `[{4, 3}]`.
     - Visited set: `{3, 10, 6, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4}`.
   - Dequeue `4` (level `3`):
     - No unvisited neighbors.

### Final Result:
- The maximum infection level (`max_Level`) is `3`. This is the time taken to infect all nodes in the tree starting from node `3`.
