1. **Length Check**: Start by comparing the lengths of both words. If they are not equal, return false immediately.

2. **Frequency Maps (m1, m2)**: Create two maps (`unordered_map`) to count the frequency of each character in both words (`word1` and `word2`). Iterate through each word, incrementing the corresponding character's frequency in the respective map.

3. **Character Existence Check**: Iterate over the first map (`m1`). For each character, check if it exists in the second map (`m2`). If a character is missing, return false.

4. **Frequency Histograms (h1, h2)**: Create two additional maps to track the frequencies of frequencies. For each entry in `m1` and `m2`, increment the count of that frequency in `h1` and `h2` respectively.

5. **Frequency Comparison**: Iterate over the first histogram (`h1`). For each frequency, check two conditions in `h2`: 
    - If the frequency does not exist, return false.
    - If the count of that frequency differs, return false.

6. **Final Verdict**: If all checks are passed, return true.

These notes encapsulate the core logic of your algorithm for checking if two words are "close" based on their character frequencies.
