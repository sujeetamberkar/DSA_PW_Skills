1. **Function Purpose**: 
   - The `topview` function prints the top view of a binary tree.

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - Horizontal Distance (HD): A measure of node's position relative to the root. Root has HD = 0, left child has HD - 1, and right child has HD + 1.
   - Top View: Nodes visible when looking down from above the tree. For each HD, only the first node encountered is part of the top view.

3. **Data Structures**:
   - `unordered_map<int, int> m`: Maps HD to node value. Ensures for each HD, only the first encountered node is recorded.
   - `queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> q`: Facilitates level order traversal, storing nodes with their HD.

4. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: Start with the root node at HD = 0.
   - **Level Order Traversal**:
     - Enqueue root node with its HD.
     - While queue is not empty:
       - Dequeue a node. Let's call it `current`.
       - If HD of `current` is not in map `m`, add it. This ensures the first node at each HD is recorded.
       - If `current` has a left child, enqueue it with HD - 1.
       - If `current` has a right child, enqueue it with HD + 1.

5. **Determining the Range of HD**:
   - After traversal, iterate through map `m` to find the minimum and maximum HD.

6. **Printing the Top View**:
   - Iterate from `min_Level` to `max_Level`, printing the node values for each HD in the range.

7. **Logic Behind the Approach**:
   - By using level order traversal, the algorithm ensures it visits nodes level by level, starting from the top of the tree. 
   - Recording only the first node for each HD captures the essence of the top view â€“ only the highest node at each horizontal position is visible.

8. **Why Use a Map?**:
   - The map provides an efficient way to check if a node at a particular HD has already been encountered. It also easily facilitates the final step of printing the nodes in order from the leftmost to the rightmost part of the tree.

9. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n), as each node is visited once.
   - Space Complexity: O(n), primarily for the queue and map.

This function, through its mix of level order traversal and horizontal distance tracking, effectively identifies and prints the nodes that constitute the top view of a binary tree.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The root node (`1`) starts with a horizontal distance (HD) of `0`.

2. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Start with root node `1` at HD = 0.
   - Enqueue `(1, 0)`.

3. **Processing the Queue**:
   - Dequeue `(1, 0)`. Since HD `0` is not in the map, add `{0: 1}` to the map.
   - Enqueue left child `(2, -1)` and right child `(3, 1)`.

4. **Continue Traversal**:
   - Dequeue `(2, -1)`. Since HD `-1` is not in the map, add `{-1: 2}` to the map.
   - Enqueue left child `(4, -2)` and right child `(5, 0)`. Note: `(5, 0)` won't affect the map since HD `0` is already present.
   - Dequeue `(3, 1)`. Since HD `1` is not in the map, add `{1: 3}` to the map.
   - Enqueue right child `(6, 2)`.

5. **Further Nodes**:
   - Dequeue `(4, -2)`. Since HD `-2` is not in the map, add `{-2: 4}` to the map.
   - `(5, 0)` is dequeued, but no action is taken as HD `0` is already in the map.
   - Dequeue `(6, 2)`. Since HD `2` is not in the map, add `{2: 6}` to the map.
   - Enqueue left child `(7, 1)` and right child `(8, 3)` of `5`.
   - Note: `(7, 1)` won't affect the map as HD `1` is already present.

6. **Final Nodes**:
   - Dequeue `(8, 3)`. Since HD `3` is not in the map, add `{3: 8}` to the map.

7. **Map Content**:
   - The map now contains `{ -2: 4, -1: 2, 0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 6, 3: 8 }`.

8. **Determining the Range of HD**:
   - `min_Level = -2`, `max_Level = 3`.

9. **Printing the Top View**:
   - Print values for each HD from `-2` to `3`: `4 2 1 3 6 8`.

The top view of this tree is `4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 8`. The function essentially picks the first node it encounters at each horizontal level during a level order traversal. This results in a view that would be seen if the tree were viewed from the top, with only the highest nodes at each horizontal position visible.
