# Binary Search Tree
    - 1) At every node the nodes left to that node should be less than the root node and right greater 


    - 2) 
        LST < root->val < RST
        LST <= root->val < RST

## Disadvantage 
    - 1) Lack of support for range queries
    - 2) Not that efficient in case of unbalanced Trees

## Time Complexity
    - 1) Best Case : O (Log (n))
    - 2) Worst Case: O (n)
    - 3) Average Case: O (height of Tree)

## Space Complexity

### Same as TC
    - 1) Best Case : O (Log (n))
    - 2) Worst Case: O (n)
    - 3) Average Case: O (height of Tree)

 - 1 ) InOrder of a Binarry Search Tree is a sorted Array
