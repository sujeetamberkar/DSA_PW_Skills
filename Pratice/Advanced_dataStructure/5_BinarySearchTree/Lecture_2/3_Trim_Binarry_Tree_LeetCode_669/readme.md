Here's a brief breakdown of the algorithm for trimming a Binary Search Tree (BST) within a given range:

- **Function `trim`**
  - Input: TreeNode `root`, int `lo`, int `hi`
  - Base case: If `root` is `NULL`, return
  - **Trim Left Subtree**
    - While `root->left` is not `NULL`
      - If `root->left->val` < `lo`
        - Move to right child (`root->left = root->left->right`)
      - Else if `root->left->val` > `hi`
        - Move to left child (`root->left = root->left->left`)
      - Else, break loop
  - **Trim Right Subtree**
    - While `root->right` is not `NULL`
      - If `root->right->val` > `hi`
        - Move to left child (`root->right = root->right->left`)
      - Else if `root->right->val` < `lo`
        - Move to right child (`root->right = root->right->right`)
      - Else, break loop
  - Recursive calls on left and right children (`trim(root->left, lo, hi)` and `trim(root->right, lo, hi)`)

- **Function `trimBST`**
  - Input: TreeNode `root`, int `low`, int `high`
  - Create a dummy node with `INT_MAX`
  - Set `dummy->left` to `root`
  - Call `trim` on `dummy` with `low` and `high`
  - Return `dummy->left` (trimmed tree)

This algorithm essentially trims the BST such that all its elements are within the `low` and `high` range, removing elements outside this range. It handles both the left and right subtrees separately and uses recursion to apply trimming to all nodes in the tree.


Let's do a dry run of the `trimBST` function with the given inputs. The initial Binary Search Tree (BST) represented by `[3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1]` with `low = 1` and `high = 3` looks like this:

```
        3
       / \
      0   4
       \
        2
       /
      1
```

**Goal:** Trim this BST so that all elements are within the range [1, 3].

### Step-by-Step Dry Run:

1. **Start with the root (3)**:
   - Root value (3) is within [1, 3]. No change.
   - Move to its children.

2. **Left Child of Root (0)**:
   - 0 < 1 (low)
   - Replace this node with its right child (2).

   Updated Tree:
   ```
        3
       / \
      2   4
     /
    1
   ```

3. **Right Child of Root (4)**:
   - 4 > 3 (high)
   - Replace this node with its left child (null).

   Updated Tree:
   ```
        3
       / 
      2   
     /
    1
   ```

4. **Move to Left Subtree (2)**:
   - 2 is within [1, 3]. No change.
   - Check its left child (1).

5. **Left Child of Node 2 (1)**:
   - 1 is within [1, 3]. No change.

6. **Right Child of Node 2 (null)**:
   - No action.

7. **Recursively Apply to All Nodes**:
   - The recursive calls will not make further changes as all remaining nodes are within the range.

### Final Trimmed BST:
```
    3
   / 
  2   
 /
1
```

**Conclusion:** The trimmed BST contains nodes with values 1, 2, and 3, all within the specified range [1, 3].
