1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an answer vector to store all valid paths.
   - Create a temporary path vector to store the current path.

2. **Recursive Path Sum Helper**:
   - Check if the current node is NULL, return immediately.
   - If the current node is a leaf (no children), check if its value equals the remaining sum.
     - If it does, add the node's value to the current path and add the current path to the answer.
     - Return to avoid further unnecessary recursive calls.
   - Add the current node's value to the current path.
   - Recursively call the helper function for the left child, decreasing the remaining sum by the current node's value.
   - Recursively call the helper function for the right child, decreasing the remaining sum by the current node's value.
