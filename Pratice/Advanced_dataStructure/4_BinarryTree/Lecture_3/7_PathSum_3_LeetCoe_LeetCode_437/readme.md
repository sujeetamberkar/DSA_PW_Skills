1. **Path Sum Counting Logic**:
   - Define a helper function to recursively count paths with a sum that equals the target.
   - If the current node is NULL, return immediately to avoid further processing.
   - Increment the count if the current node's value equals the remaining sum.
   - Recursively call the helper function for both left and right children, decreasing the remaining sum by the current node's value.

2. **Aggregate Path Sum Count**:
   - In the `pathSum` function, start with a count of 0.
   - Call the helper function with the current root to count paths starting from the root node.
   - Recursively call `pathSum` for the left and right children as new roots to count all paths in the subtree, not just those starting from the original root.
   - Add the counts from the current root and both subtrees.
