# Data Abstracation 
    - 1) To hide the data some data 
    - 2) Cant expose everything 
    - 3) To create a better customer experience

    -4) Acess Modefier (public, private, Protected)
    - Protected and Private cant be acessed from outside 
    - Protected can be inherited 

# Data Encapsulation
    ```
    class Player {
        int health;
        int score;
        String name;
    }
    ```
    - 1) Now lets encapsulate this data and bind it together for each player


    ```
    class Student{
        char name[];
        int rollNO;
        int age;
        int mobNo;
        char address[50];
    }
    ```
    now Student is a user defined data type

# Inheritance 
    - 1 ) When we create multiple classes, To re-user the some part of code
    - 2 ) We alredy have a player class, Now we will create a zombie class which will inherit the property of player class

# Polymorphism
    - 1) get different functionality from the same function 



## WHat is class
    - 1) Class is something like a blueprint 


## Object
    - 1) A object is an instance of a class
