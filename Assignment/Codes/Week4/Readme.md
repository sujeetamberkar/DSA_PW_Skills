## Q5: The minimum number of functions present in any C++ program is:
Answer:
1
Main function is always present.

## Q6: State True or False
    
    1) A function may be called more than once from any other function

        -> True

    2) It is necessary for a function to return some value.

        -> False, Void function returns no value

## Q7) Explore: Can the same function name be used for different functions without any conflict?

 It is not possible to define multiple functions with the same name and the exact same parameter types and return type without encountering a compilation error.

 But However, if the functions have same name but different parameters list then that is called overloaded function.
